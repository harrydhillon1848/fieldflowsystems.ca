<h1>About FieldFlow Systems</h1>

  <p>
    FieldFlow Systems is a BC-registered sole proprietorship focused on operational
    clarity, safety, and compliance in high-risk, procedure-driven environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work is informed by firsthand experience in operations where permits,
    standing orders, and approvals are part of daily execution — not documentation
    exercises created after the fact.
  </p>

  <p>
    The objective is not broad digital transformation. It is to make critical
    workflows explicit, auditable, and usable where the work actually happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    FieldFlow Systems exists to support operators, supervisors, and safety leads
    with systems that respect how work is done, how risk is managed, and how
    accountability is maintained.
