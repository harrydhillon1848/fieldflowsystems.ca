    <h1>Operational workflow systems for high-risk, procedure-driven environments</h1>

  <p>
    FieldFlow Systems builds digital workflow and safety systems for operations
    where permits, procedures, and approvals are not paperwork — they are controls.
  </p>

  <p>
    We work in environments such as marine terminals, barging operations, ports,
    and logistics facilities where work is performed under standing orders,
    regulated permits, and real operational risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our systems digitize and structure:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Operational permits (e.g. confined space, hot work)</li>
    <li>SOPs and standing orders</li>
    <li>Role-based approvals and sign-offs</li>
    <li>Incident and safety reporting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not sell off-the-shelf software. We build operator-informed systems,
    prototype them in the field, and refine them through controlled pilots
    before any broader implementation.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are responsible for operations, safety, or compliance and want to
    explore whether a focused digital workflow system makes sense for your
    environment, we start with a conversation.
