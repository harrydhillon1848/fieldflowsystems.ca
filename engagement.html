<h1>Engagement Model</h1>

  <p>
    We work through a staged engagement model designed to reduce operational risk
        <div class="container">
                <section class="panel">
    and avoid large upfront commitments.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    We start by understanding the operation, the procedures, and the risk points.
    A focused prototype is built around a specific workflow (e.g. a permit type,
    approval chain, or reporting process).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Pilot</h2>
  <p>
    The prototype is tested in live operations with a limited user group.
    Feedback is gathered from operators, supervisors, and safety leads.
    Changes are made quickly and deliberately.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Custom Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    Only after value is demonstrated do we expand or formalize the system.
    Scope, access, and controls are defined with the operation.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not lock clients into platforms or subscriptions.
    Each engagement is scoped deliberately and reviewed at every stage.
