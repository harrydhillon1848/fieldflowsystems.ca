                <h1>What We Build</h1>
                <p>We build digital workflow and safety systems for procedure-driven operations (permits, SOPs, approvals, incident reporting).</p>

                <h2>Representative Systems We Build</h2>

                <p><strong>Permit-to-Work Systems</strong></p>
                <p>Digital permit workflows for confined space, hot work, isolation, and similar high-risk activities. Each permit captures required conditions, approvals, and closures in structured records that support compliance audits and incident reviews.</p>

                <p><strong>SOP & Standing Order Execution</strong></p>
                <p>Structured checklists and approval workflows for recurring operational tasks. Operators complete procedures step-by-step, supervisors validate completion, and the system maintains records of what was done, when, and by whom.</p>

                <p><strong>Role-Based Approvals & Accountability</strong></p>
                <p>Authority matrices and multi-level approval chains for operational decisions. The system enforces sign-off requirements based on roles and ensures actions requiring authorization cannot proceed without the appropriate approval.</p>

                <p><strong>Incident & Safety Reporting</strong></p>
                <p>Structured reporting for near-misses, incidents, and safety observations. Reports capture what happened, immediate actions taken, and follow-up investigations in a format that supports root cause analysis and corrective action tracking.</p>

                <p>All systems are scoped per operation and developed in collaboration with on-site teams. We do not offer generic, off-the-shelf software.</p>

                <p>If you're responsible for operations or safety and evaluating whether a scoped system makes sense for your facility, we start with a focused discussion about your requirements.</p>
